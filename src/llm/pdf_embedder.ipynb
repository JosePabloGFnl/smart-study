       "'The main feature of the Fast Vertex Substitution algorithm is its ability to reduce the complete I neighborhood during iterations. This neighborhood, denoted as /H5114(X), is obtained by replacing each facility in the solution with each facility outside of it. The cardinality of /H5114(X) is p/H18528(n/H11002p), where p is the number of facilities and n is the total number of facilities. The algorithm uses the I local search heuristic, which finds the best solution X/H11032/H20678 in /H5114(X). If the objective function value of X/H11032 is better than that of X, a move is made to X/H11032, a new neighborhood is defined, and the process is repeated. The algorithm stops when a local minimum is reached. The Fast Vertex Substitution algorithm is implemented with close attention to data structures, ensuring a low worst-case complexity of O(mn), where m is the number of facilities and n is the total number of facilities.'"
